       "'Charles Dickens: The Complete NovelsKindle Edition$2.994.7 out of 5 stars[\\'What a pleasure to have all Dickens\\\\\\' novels together in a weightless electronic library! I\\\\\\'m not the sort who likes (or has room for) hundreds of dusty books, and the Kindle makes it all so easy.The greatest pleasure that I derive from these novels is a sense of period: a detailed picture of the world nearly 200 years ago. The elaborate preperations required to get even a ramshakle horse and cart underway for an endless and perilous journey over potholes to some isolated village in the heart of the country, which is today a London suburb. When all there was to eat was some revolting scraps that hadn\\\\\\'t quite rotted and the only beverages that were safe to drink were alcoholic...Dickens is often exquisitely funny, and his characters are justifiably memorable. As has been noted before, his good heroic characters are far less interesting than his twisted, crazy and bad ones. His plots are a bit tired and drag on like an endlessTV soap opera, because he published these works in a weekly serial form and got paid by the length. But thats all a given: Dickens is Dickens. His social conscience shines through: it really is breathtaking to realize that he made a mentally retarded person into the hero of Barnaby Rudge, and that he made some amends for the Jewish caricature of Fagin in Oliver Twist through his sympathetic portrayal of Riah, the Jew in Our Mutual Friend. Another unforgetable moment is his description of 1830\\\\\\'s New York ( in Martin Chuzzelwitt) as a \\\\\\'flat, muddy, misty town\".So this really is a superb collection\\', \"An excellent compilation of Dickens\\' novels. Any scanning errors have obviously been corrected by good proof reading. It\\'s difficult to navigate or search for a particular novel with the entire collection of over one hundred thousand pages combined on the single navigation slider.\", \\'Having never read Dickens I did not know what to expect, Since reading Martin Chuzzelwit, A Tale of Two Cities, now starting Nicholas Nickalby, one word describes this author, Brilliant. The surrounding details and characters draw you into the story making you feel a part of all that is happening. If you have never read him you are missing a blessing, if you have read him, return you will not regret it.\\']\\nDickensianPrime Videounknown-price4.3 out of 5 stars[\\'What an absolute shame the BBC didn’t continue this series. It is a must see for any Dickens buff! Wonderful actors and wonderful scenery. I hated to come to the end of the 20th episode. However do not let the fact that this is only the first season stop you. It does culminate as far as the major plot is concerned. And if you have read the books it doesn’t matter because you know where Dickens took his characters.Some may not care for the characters mixing with each other outside of their books but I loved it and I think Dickens would have too.The biggest sin here is that Dickens didn’t write it himself...but it certainly sounds like Dickens.\\', \\'It took a little while for the story to get going, and the viewer will have to be reasonably familiar with the Dickens characters. This is a Whodunit, and a fairly good one at that. The viewer will really have to suspend disbelief for this series,  Entertaining as the characters behave as Dickens wrote them. If Sherlock Holmes were a Dickens creation he would have his hands full with this crowd. Slow in spots, but not enough to turn off the viewer.\\', \\'I admit that I was a bit reluctant to start this. Of course, I\\\\\\'ve read Dickens over the decades but didn\\\\\\'t know if I\\\\\\'d be expected to remember plots & characters. Well, you don\\\\\\'t. This is a superbly-written murder mystery that uses the characters from Dickens\\\\\\' writings. Remembering a bit about some of the characters certainly helps but not essential. Here we meet Miss Havisham as a young woman before she\\\\\\'s the old lady living in the past that we know from \"Great Expectations.\" Grab it when it comes out.\\']\\nThe Charles Dickens CollectionKindle$0.994.3 out of 5 stars[\"The books are small, very plain Jane in appearance, and the print is quite small.  But that\\'s pretty much what you expect considering the low price and squeezing several books into a small size.  In hindsight, I wish I had paid more for better, separate books.\", \\'I feel very lucky to have discovered this now.  I am shocked at how easy to read and understand Dickinson‘s writing is.  Of course I have no clue about the slang, but that’s not important. The great thing about the Kindle edition is that I can very quickly look up words that I mostly know but would like exact definitions of. I marvel at the occasional sentences that run the full length of a page. I enjoy his humor as I suspect that he did this for fun just to show that it’s possible.\\', \"The bindings and slip case are very attractive. I really have enjoyed (and studied) the illustrations. So far I am most of the way through Oliver Twist.. I\\'d give this set five stars but I am 78 yrs. old and the print is VERY small...so small that it has slowed my reading speed.\"]\\nCharles Dickens: The Complete NovelsKindle$1.994.7 out of 5 stars[\"It\\'s great to have so many Charles Dickens novels in one ebook file. I am currently reading Barnaby Rush, which was not included in the Dickens novel collection I purchased years ago in hard cover.I am always amazed when I read Dickens at how well crafted his sentences are. I think anyone who has a love of the English language will also love most of the Dickens novels. I have a hard time choosing a favorite. I read Tale of Two Cities for the first time in high school, and I keep coming back to it. I\\'ve read David Copperfield and A Christmas Carol umpteen times each, and Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, Hard Times, Bleak House several times each.I highly recommend this collection of Charles Dickens novels to anyone who enjoys excellent prose. He was undoubtedly one of the best writers that the English language has ever produced.\", \"Yes, this collection contains all of Dickens\\' novels, but NOT in the correct order of publication. Yes, it contains two indices, but they are not helpful in the least. Moreover, it is not possible to know how much estimated reading time is left in any individual chapter or book.I\\'m about to go looking for a different collection.\", \\'I was disappointed because when it says \"Complete\" I assumed it also contained a Christmas Carol which it does not. The price wasn\\\\\\'t bad so I just purchased a Christmas Carol separately.\\']\\nGreat Expectations (AmazonClassics Edition)Kindle$0.004.3 out of 5 stars[\"This is a TERRIBLE abridgment.  Going off the reviews, I thought this would work for my students as an abridgment of the classic for their summer reading, and I honestly thought it might be the same one I used to use when teaching it during the school year from an out of print textbook.  I WAS SO WRONG.  This abridgment leaves out key things that make the parts it leaves in impossible to understand if you aren\\'t already familiar with the story.  I am SO embarrassed that I suggested parents buy this catastrophe of an abridgment.  The publishers should be ashamed of the way they have butchered this classic.\", \\'Oh, the beauty and the agony tears at me as I think about this stunning story. The characters are vivid and the settings so well written that I was transported to the graveyard alongside young Pip and his convict, fear streaking through me as it was for that small boy torn by a near-impossible decision. And I’m there with Pip and kind-hearted Joe in the forge. I can feel the fire on my skin and taste hot metal on the back of my tongue. In my mind, I hear the crackling of the decades-old crinoline of Miss Havisham’s skirts rustling against the marble floors of the mausoleum she calls home. Amid the stopping of Miss Havisham’s clock, the cool radiance that is Estella vibrates from the pages, bringing her to life.If you haven’t read <i>Great Expectations</i>, I encourage you to do so. Yes, it was first published in 1861, and the syntax is more eloquent than that we’ve become accustomed to, but once this tale grabs hold, you will forget the language and year it was written and be all in with these new friends. The love, the heartbreak and the lessons still hold true today. Some choices, once made, can leave long-reaching scars on the hearts of those we never knew we touched. A good deed can ripple through time to places never imagined. The consequences of our actions must be accounted for, and there will always be outcomes we could never have anticipated.<i>Great Expectations</i> is the real deal! The deliciously-satisfying prose is the whipped cream on the proverbial sundae that is Dickens. The plot and subplots (and sub-subplots) are astounding! The way he can weave this tangled web yet keep the interest of the reader while giving nothing away until the perfect moment … and BAM! He has you, and you sigh with the perfection of it all.You’ve missed a gorgeous piece of literature if you don’t dive into this book.\\', \"I avoided reading books by Charles Dickens because I thought the old style of English would be too tough to work through and keep my interest. I was wrong. I waited 64 years before I figured this out. Maybe I needed to wait until this before I could appreciate his work.It is basically a story of a young orphan boy, named Pip, coming of age in the mid- 19th century. It is a life full of characters both good, bad and in between. The main thrust though is how theses characters all affect young Pip\\'s beliefs; fears and... great expectations. As he grows he finds that many are not what he originally thought them to be. However, they are what they are. The story is about how Pip learns to deal with them and life\\'s twist and turns.It is really a good book. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is tough to read in a few spots but you can still get the context and keep the story moving along. I highly recommend this book, but you will have to decide if you are old enough to appreciate it. Just don\\'t wait too long...\"]\\nCharles Dickens: Four Novels (Leather-bound Classics)Leather Bound$20.304.8 out of 5 stars[\\'This collection of stories is perfect. I have bought 19 of the Canterbury Classic Leather Bound books. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL! The quality is incomparable. The acid free paper. The gold gilded page edges are lovely to look at, and a joy to turn. They all have a built in ribbon bookmark. 2018. My resolution was to start my home library; compiling the classics first. And, these are must have classics for anyone who genuinely loves books.\\', \\'I couldn’t have been more happy with this book. The look, the feel, and the selection of titles. It has become a favorite. The classic feel to the design just fits.\\', \\'Typeset very small for 69 year old eyes.\\']\\nMajor Works of Charles Dickens: Great Expectations; Hard Times; Oliver Twist; A Christmas Carol; Bleak House; A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Clothbound Classics)Kindle$0.494.3 out of 5 stars[\\'Would be 5 stats but the books themselves had label stickers on them that pulled the design off the cover.... really ruins beautiful books.\\', \\'This set of books by Dickens is worth every penny. The cloth-bound covers are decent enough and the paper quality is good. But, the introduction to every book on this collection is priceless. Penguin went all the way in selecting  amazing editors for the book introductions. They were a pleasure to read and they will help you to fully understand and appreciate these Dickens jewels.\\', \\'What a pleasure it is to read a good book or six! After reading through this collection, the remaining works of CD are must reads.Skip the introductions and notes. The former are - at times - salted with modern slants aimed towards the ridiculous and the latter - at times - tend to reveal events (in the literature) yet to be occur.Plot, setting, and character are richly developed in each story.For those who might think these books too \"difficult\" - horse hockey! It was pleasure to read \"Great Expectations\" without worrying about the color of some characters apparel or memorize the closing thoughts expressed in \"ATOTC\". In each story there arose a pinnacle of action - something unexpected - that caused this reader to halt in mild shock. Did that just happen? Oh my!Listed in order of this reader\\\\\\'s favorites here are the books in this collection: A Tale of Two Cities/ / Bleak House / A Christmas Carol ( &c. ) / Oliver Twist / Hard Times / Great Expectations ; there is not a dud nor a near dud in the lot.\\']\\nNicholas NicklebyPrime Videounknown-price4.4 out of 5 stars[\\'A fine, fine piece of work. When I first read the description I thought I\\\\\\'d not enjoy this. WRONG. It was the hundreds of near-perfect amazon reviews that persuaded me ... do let those sway you also.A timeless storyline, weaving together the joys and tragedies of life and family, the foul connections that family bonds can bring, and the joy of choosing one\\\\\\'s family members over tolerating those we find intolerable. One of the finest movie endings I\\\\\\'ve seen in 50 years.A hearty high-fives to Douglas McGrath for this masterpiece. I should not have thought a Dickens novel could be brought to such vibrant life on the screen. Tom Courtenay is referred to as an \"acting chameleon\" on IMDB and that is just spot on -- his portrayal in Nicholas Nickleby as Mr. Noggs is five-star; you can\\\\\\'t quite figure out at first whether to hate him or love him or feel sorry for him. This, however, comes clear toward the latter part of the movie. Christopher Plummer, though, as Ralph Nickleby, well, that\\\\\\'s easy. You hate him instantly and it just grows in intensity throughout the story. Every one of the rest of the cast merits accolades, not least Mr. and Mrs. Squeers and the fantastic acting company. I wish I could give them 6 stars.\\', \"A delightful adaptation of the story of Nicholas Nickleby. Christopher Plummer is outstanding in his role as the elder Nicholas, a villain whose treachery is devious and frightening. The movie features bucholic views of the English countryside, contrasting starkly with the dark despondency of the boys\\' school, Dotheboys Hall, in Yorkshire. Be aware that this is a true example of the schools unwanted children were forced to attend during that period in England. The plot is tight, with the usual Dickensian twists. Expect humor with the usual tear jerkers Dickens always delivers in his art.I have been a consumate devotee of Charles Dickens since I first read David Copperfield when I was eight years of age and someone gave me an old dog eared used book. I subsequently devoured every book he wrote, and have returned to read each of them over and over again as an adult. Charles Dickens is a master storyteller and his characters and their development have no equal in Classic Literature.  He has remained my favorite author and his works are timeless and enduring.\", \"A very nice movie about kindness, hardship, and family.  A well to do family lost it all due to poor investments, and the father dies and leaves behind a son, a daughter and wife with nothing.  They turn to their wealthy uncle for help only to find that the uncle is evil in every way and wants nothing but to wish them harm and watch them suffer.  The son, Nicholas Nickleby, with little work experience does what ever work his uncle offers only to find himself sent away watching young people getting beaten and mistreated.  He manages to save one young man and returns home to save his sister and mother from abuse.  In his journey, he meets many people who are kind and offers him work, so that he can care for his family.  His uncle, envy of people siding with Nicholas, does everything to destroy Nicholas.  It\\'s nice to see how being a good person can pay off in the end.Charlie Hunnam who plays Nicholas nickleby looks so much like Heath Ledger that one cannot help but to think Heath Ledger is re-born or to think they are twin brothers of different times.  I look forward to more movies from Charlie Hunnam and may his career follows the success of Heath Ledger\\'s career.  If I didn\\'t look up the actor\\'s name, I would have thought it was Heath Ledger (actor from Brokeback Mountain) in this movie.  So nice to see another great actor who looks like Heath Ledger.\"]\\nDavid CopperfieldKindle$0.004.5 out of 5 stars[\"This could be the height or the depth of Dickens\\' art. It is up to you.David Copperfield is such an empty vessel, such s pliable lump of clay. How could anyone take interest in him?He does not mark the world but seems to take on the shape impressed on him by those around him. He does not affect the world but is affected by it. If you stop there,, he is the most boring character in the world.But if you watch closely, you will see that he gathers shape from the honest and good hearted around him and seems unaffected by the cruel and heartless people around him. As he grows, he becomes more worthy and more a magnet to the honest and. good hearted. As he becomes more worthy, his story becomes more profound and insightful, if you can see it.  Is Dickens a moldy 18th century relic or a mirror to wholeness and richness in your life? It is more up to you than to Dickens.\", \\'One of the best books ever written. You will never forget David C! I don\\\\\\'t know how I missed it growing up but a book reviewer in the WSJ  alluded to it and said that the main character in his book was much like David: you are sad at the end that you will never get more of him. I broke with my \"best seller\" policy, and love of spy novels and action books, and ordered it. I can\\\\\\'t wait for bedtime to get another hour of reading in of this 1000 page paperback I got fro m Amazon. yes, the start is a little slow until one becomes accustomed to the language and phrasing of the time, but by page 50 the book owns you. Dickens really rocks~!\\', \\'Dickens is the consummate author, whose skills are exceeded by no other. In this, his favorite novel, he takes us on a journey through the life of David Copperfield—his painful childhood, his love for his wonderful Aunt Betsy, who raised her orphaned nephew & always stood by his side, through his lean years and through his successful latter years. Dickens develops the friends & loves of this gentile character (AKA Trotman) in a delicious, spellbinding portraiture. It’s a tale of the best & worst of human character & conditions—some will rise above & some will fall. It’s a tale of abuse, scheming, hatred, and arrogance (the ugliest ice traits of mankind) set apart from humility, kindness & generosity. It is a story of loss & redemption. This wonderful classic kept me enraptured by its ever-changing script. I am truly inspired by this great literary work.\\']\\nHard TimesPaperback$7.494.1 out of 5 stars[\"This novel was a challenge to me albeit a shorter story than most, not so much the content but with his very creative colorful characters he also incorporated one with a lisp, that couldn\\'t pronounce his “s” and another that spoke in a very “cockney” accent.  In able to understand the content I needed to slow down and read the passages aloud.  Very clever and somewhat playful Mr. Dickens.  As with his other novels he wrote about the down trodden, misunderstood and serious difficulties of the lower members of society.  The story takes place in Coletown, a dreary place to be sure with all the smoke from factories polluting the environment.  There is not one or singular protagonist in the story, many have a story to tell.  A child abandoned by her father who is a circus performer and has lost his touch and wants a better life for her.  An educator who believes all children should learn only facts and nothing but facts so even his own children don\\'t know how to deal with society or relationships in general.  A bank and mill owner who lives a lie.  A poor mill worker, stuck with an alcoholic wife. Dickens even has added one of those ladies who is in everyone\\'s business and a libertine.  Very entertaining even though melancholy at times I highly recommend.\", \"Hard Times by Charles Dickens was very good and engaging at all times. This was Dickens answer to Adam Smith. He posits that compassion and understanding are as important for a good life as acting in one\\'s own self interest. He mocks the idea that fate responds only to self interest. I recommend this book highly. You can never go wrong with Dickens!\", \\'I was a little hesitant to read this novel because I had heard it was boring and flat, but I chose to do so because I had read four of Dickens books already, and enjoyed them very much (especially \"David Copperfield\"), and because it looked like a fairly quick read. (Quick for Charles Dickens, that is!)  It was not disappointing! So good! I enjoyed every page of this great classic! The plot is intriguing, and how all the characters turned out at the end of the book. It is made up of three sections, \"Sowing\", \"Reaping\" and \"Garnering\". It shows the disadvantages of living life by fact, and fact alone. It doesn\\\\\\'t have that light-hearted of an ending, but it is resolute. Like most Dickens books, the characters are all distinct and very non-forgettable.So, if you\\\\\\'re looking for a classic, check out this book!\\']\\nHer Lovestruck Lord (Wicked Husbands Book 2)Kindle Edition$0.004.1 out of 5 stars[\\'Just finished this book. The stars I awarded were based on Ms. Scott’s character development. The characters all seem like real, 3D people with flaws and history, and that is worth something.After a year (!!) of enduring her husband’s public infidelity, Maggie goes to a wild party, intent on finding a lover of her own. Unknown to Maggie, her husband and his mistress have broken up and Simon came to the same party looking for a replacement. The lover Maggie ultimately finds is - wait for it - her husband. After some arguing, Maggie and Simon decide to give their marriage a shot.I felt bad for Simon. And I suppose I could see how Maggie, a young romantic poet, could find someone like him attractive. But I spent most of the book wanting to shake her. He’s an arrogant jerk. Maggie is too nice to him. Ms. Scott’s other heroines are genuinely strong. Maggie just has a big mouth. She’s too easily manipulated by good sex. She falls for Simon when he’s really, really hard to love.Overcoming a year of flagrant infidelity and public scorn should’ve been enough obstacles to throw at this couple, but just when they’re finding their way, Elenor (the mistress) shows up to torch it. She claims she’s been abused and Simon allows her to stay with them. (Dude. Really? Think. He didn’t have to send her back to the mean husband, but he owes Elenor nothing. Didn’t Simon realize this was a terrible, painful idea for everyone involved?) And Maggie allows this crap, though she gives Elenor an earful. But I’d have respected her more if she gave Simon an ultimatum. “It’s her or me, you a$$hole” would’ve been appropriate here. But no, Maggie just mopes and then they have sex. Elenor climbs into Simon’s bed naked with Maggie next door. Maggie finally gets PO’d enough to walk out, but Simon finds her in ten seconds. A tragic plot twist ultimately separates the couple for another month, sending Maggie back to the hostess of the original party to lick her wounds. Simon arrives, punches a guy, explains his actions (sort of - a lot of the explanation is actually inner monologue) and they fall into bed.Really, Maggie girl, cut your losses and run.The HEA happens as expected, but I’m not comfortable with it. I just don’t trust Simon to stick around.\\', \\'I read the sample of the book and it did not reveal the language it used or the other profanity or I would not have ordered it.\\', \\'I love Scarlett Scott. If you like clean romances, she’s not the author for you. That’s one of the things I love about her. She does her due diligence with historical research and weaves accurate details into her steamy fictional works.This is one of my top three reads including Sweet Scandal and Her Deceptive Duke.My opinion differs from other reviewers here. I think our heroine, Maggie, is a strong character. Don’t evaluate a regency character by contemporary social standards. Women had next to no rights back then!I loved this book and have revisited it several times. Scott’s books are a wonderful escape!\\']\\nLittle DorritPrime Videounknown-price4.5 out of 5 stars[\\'Grand collaboration of BBC with American PBS Boston Masterpiece Theatre on this adaptation by award-winning screenwriter of the latest \"Pride & Prejudice\" and \"Bleak House,\" this seven Emmy Award winning \"Outstanding Mini-Series\" would thrill Dickens and if not already make \"Little Dorritt\" one of your favorite of the subscription tales spun by Victorian England novelist/social awareness & humanitarian conscience rouser Charles Dickens, on a par with \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"A Christmas Carol.\"Timeless everyman themes of life\\\\\\'s ups & downs including unquenchable Cinderella hopes and romance fetchingly set in Victorian trimmings and starkly contrasting social caste drama is so mesmerizing that you won\\\\\\'t even mind Dickens\\\\\\' too far-fetched mystery premise reveal at the end defying credulity but who cares about that post-script to the pre-eminent character developments & story lines interwoven in a Dickens tapestry of quirkily originals whose whimsical humorous names celebrating Britishness are as entertaining as their characters.The appealingly attractively and/or intriguing cast serve up iconic Britishness in beautifully scripted expressions delivered with such clarity of enunciated diction that we across the Pond can get most of it too, with the exception of an occasional non-integral bit of idiom or low accent here or there; and transcend period/locale London gloom intermingled with a seachange in Venice, challenging viewers to imagine how we would respond in and to the situations and circumstances.I won\\\\\\'t be passing this along like most DVDs after savoring those meriting a second go-round, as this one\\\\\\'s a keeper I\\\\\\'ll have to buy more to gift others without hesitation since tastefully not raunchy nor graphic even when conveying the grimness of Marshalsea Debtors Prison the likes of which made offspring USA craft bankruptcy forgiveness & restitution laws and a rather more productive correctional system. I see no age rating on the series, but harsh or adult themes are so obliquely alluded that I would think most adults would be comfortable with a range of young adult age viewing, like much that went over my head in the classics when I was young and \"ivory tower\" sheltered from what 21st Century young are exposed to. Certainly this helps anyone appreciate our blessings, if only the freedom from the constricting apparel and unnaturally inactive lifestyle of the Victorian lady, and the less sophisticated amenities then of even urban living. Yet so much of the high tone and style has gone with it, that we moderns enjoy period dramas of the glories of days of yore.\\', \\'A wonderful rendition of this Dickens serial, Claire Foy lights up every scene in which she appears. Deliciously wicked performances by Judy Parfitt Amanda Redman, Anton Lesser and  Andy Serkis (who would later play Gollum in LOTR) keep the tension high, while the rest of the brilliant supporting cast provide us with rich characters who are interesting in their own rights. Beautiful cinematography both on location and in studio. One of those adaptations that is nearly better than the book. One can only hope that this will be released as a Region A/1 Blu-Ray.\\', \"OKAY....I have now seen this series four times.....and now watching it for the fifth time, I had to get up and update my earlier review!!! other reviewers have attested to how well done this is, and make no mistake, if you even like Dickens, you MUST buy this DVD.  Incredible!  I was spellbound and captivated by Claire Foy\\'s performance: I do not ever recall being so mesmerized by acting, and she captured Little Dorrit\\'s character perfectly! Every look, every gesture was so amazing. I have to say I fell in love with her character and performance. The interaction between Little Dorrit and Charles Clennam is amazing...  I had just finished the Dickens\\' book, and was curious as to how the BBC translation would be. This is Dickens at his best....and wait till you see Andy Serkis\\'s performance.....he is more evil, more malignant then Gollum in Lord of The Rings....!!  I have to say this is one of the best series, if not the BEST, I have ever seen.  I\\'m not a big media or tv fan, and if I had not read the book, would not have ordered this.  It is excellent!!!!!!! I would give it ten stars!!! Her character and this series is indelibly stamped on my memory, and I will watch it again very soon.\"]\\nDombey and SonPrime Videounknown-price3.9 out of 5 stars[\"The film depicts Dickens\\' wrenching story of a man so proud and so obsessed with establishing a male heir that he overlooks and ultimately abuses his magnificent daughter, losing much else in the process.  Redemption arises from the ashes.  Although slow to start and bedeviled by excessively long transitional moments, for instance in the extended time the camera follows people coming through doors or walking down hallways, the drama is well played and the film well preserved.  As others have noted, the film, in omitting some secondary characters, loses some of the texture and interest of the book.  More disappointing, in my view, is the crash denouement.  Even with the plot restricted to just those characters the film included, the film omits (SPOILERS coming):  the delicate and glowing scene Dickens wrote showing Florence and Walter reaching their final understanding of one another; Florence\\'s real motive for seeking a rapprochement with her estranged father; and the way the united family finally reaches its peace and happiness at the end, through the offices of the grandchildren.  The story really can bear these further developments after Walter\\'s climactic return, developments that, indeed, extend the enjoyment and provide closure.  I agree with the other reviewers who have said the story merits a new adaptation, and I hope the BBC takes up the cause.\", \"Loved the musical score, mixing light, dark and the whimsical exactly as Dickens does. But what impressed me most about this production of a Dickens adaptation was the sense of humor throughout. Too many times film producers, and yes, the BBC, seem to be so impressed that they\\'re filming a literary classic that they make it all high drama with none of the sense of the absurd, the irony and satire that made these books so appealing--what, in fact, made them classics, read and enjoyed down to this day. (See, for instance, the BBC\\'s Jane Austen film adaptations in the Seventies and Eighties.)This story of a man obsessed with his status and the narcissistic need to have a son and heir to carry on his name, at the expense of his daughter\\'s happiness (which he is utterly indifferent to), is a quieter story, less manic and less slightly-fantastic than Dickens\\' usual stories. The eccentric characters remain, the manipulative characters, the ambiguous characters, and the simple and innocent characters are all there just as in all Dickens\\' stories, but they\\'re all more subtly drawn and all the more convincing and real because of it. This felt almost more like an Elizabeth Gaskell tale, than Dickens. Nevertheless, it shouldn\\'t be missed by any Dickens fan. Excellent acting throughout--and I defy anyone not to fall in love with Dombey\\'s son. In fact, once he\\'s gone so are the best parts of the movie.The ending, as others have mentioned, was lacklustre, rushed and disappointing. You have no particular sense, if you haven\\'t already read the book, that Dombey\\'s repentence isn\\'t anything more than momentary. There\\'s nothing to indicate he wouldn\\'t go back to his prideful, dominant ways as soon as he got a good meal under his belt and was once more being reverentially fawned over by Miss Tox and lovingly worshiped by his daughter. Human nature being what it is, odds are good his humility lasted only as long as his sense of having lost all and been abandoned. The producers therefore did a disservice to the viewers and the film by not showing us his real and deep turnaround.This is a quieter, more contemplative Dickens than we are used to;  it also felt more mature, though still with its irrepressible, childishly endearing moments. A winner, best watched when you have an extended period of quiet time.\", \\'First off, I just want to say that I recently finished reading this book and purchased the film immediately after finishing the book. I really liked this film but, unfortunately, it was truly incomplete. I know that a Dickens novel tends to be very long and very rich with descriptions so some characters have to be eliminated. Also, when the BBC produced this work back in the early 1980s they were on a tight budget so perhaps some cutting was essential for them to do so.  However, after having written the above, the elimination of the James/John/Harriet Carker angle as well as the Mrs. Brown/Alice Brown segments was a huge disappointment since they are crucial pieces to Mr. Dombey\\\\\\'s redemption from a self important, self righteous, selfish, arrogant, and cold man to a humbled man. As the story goes, Mr. Dombey owns Dombey & Sons which is a shipping business  he hopes to pass on to his son and heir while his daughter grows up feeling unloved and neglected by her father after his wife dies in childbirth giving life to their son, Paul. Even in the domestic sphere Mr. Dombey runs the household as though it were a business. In the film, only James Carker, Dombey\\\\\\'s manager, gets to make an appearance.  Furthermore, as others have mentioned, the ending of the film is baffling. (HERE COMES THE SPOILER): In the book, after Florence runs away from home, she eventually gets reunited with her true love, Walter Gay, and they end up marrying while her father\\\\\\'s fortunes go tumbling like a house of cards. In the filmed version after she meets up with Walter she visits her reformed father, apologizes for running away, her father apologizes as well for his treatment of his daughter, and then that\\\\\\'s the ending. It should have shown her taking her ailing father into her married home to take care of him and showing Mr. Dombey playing with his grandchildren. Yet, to end abruptly as though the production ran out of film is strange.  In all honesty, perhaps BBC should do a remake of \"Dombey and Son\" since I am sure that BBC has gone a long way since the 1980s. True, the film itself is close to the actual book and the characters portrayed are as written in the book. The DVD is great although double-sided and the colors, print, and sound are wonderful.\\']\\nOur Mutual FriendPrime Videounknown-price3.6 out of 5 stars[\"Five stars because it is one of Dickens\\'s best; a very intriguing film with twists and turns.  Well cast and directed.On the other hand...One star for Amazon Prime deleting important scenes interfering with the development of the story.  The full movie is 350 minutes, which means there are 54 minutes missing.  Don\\'t bother watching on Amazon Prime.\", \\'The original BBC series (not the edited version Amazon is currently streaming) deserves five stars. It cut out some characters from the book but covered the story decently, although I never understood why they made Jenny Wren an old woman instead of the young girl she’s described as in the book. However, the streaming version cuts out parts that you actually need in order for the story to make sense!! You never get to see Bella and John fall in love with each other and it never shows Bella and Lizzie becoming friends!! I mean come on, if people are going to commit to watching this long of a series, nobody would have minded a few extra scenes. Do yourself a favor and buy the DVD so you can watch this as it was meant to be watched. (Abridged books and movies are the WORST.)\\', \\'Amazon need to present this production in it’s full unabridged version! Their editing has ruined the story! Shame on Amazon!\\']\\nHard TimesPrime Videounknown-price3.3 out of 5 stars[\\'I\\\\\\'m a bit saddened--but not surprised--to learn from more well-read Dickens fans that this film passes over a lot, and doesn\\\\\\'t get into certain characters and situations as much as the original novel does. That being said, I found this movie perfect for someone like myself, who\\\\\\'s very interested in the classics of literature, and in great authors, but finds he (to be completely honest and humble about it) lacks the attention-span and endurance to read the original works, which were often very lengthy and detailed, and (again, to be honest) quite dry, compared to the luscious, arguably overstimulating, fast-paced worlds of modern entertainment.Every now and then a classic or other novel will grip me and addict me. I recall Dickens\\\\\\' \"A Christmas Carol\" (a relatively short book, more like a novella), having done this to me. But honestly I\\\\\\'ve ALWAYS struggled with retaining my interest in a book over 200 pages. And Dickens\\\\\\' longer novels have failed to addict me. I much prefer reading poetry, or biographies, or nonfiction, if anything, and WATCHING \"the classics\" in filmed adaptations.By watching good filmed adaptations of the classics, I fulfill both my need and curiosity to acquaint myself with classic literature, and get a good film in at the same time.This present film of Dickens\\\\\\' HARD TIMES, I consider to belong to this latter category: A way for one to acquaint oneself with a classic piece of literature, and get a good film in at the same time.I\\\\\\'ve also been watching a lot of BBC\\\\\\'s Shakespeare films lately, via Amazon Prime Video, and I think it\\\\\\'s a credit to Charles Dickens that his HARD TIMES seemed Shakespearean to me in its depth and richness of understanding of its variety of compelling characters (good, bad, and, perhaps more surprisingly than Shakespeare ever pulled off, the good-turning-bad and the bad-turning-good), and in the ideas and emotions it summons forth. It reminds me of when I saw good film versions of DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, and especially NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and GREAT EXPECTATIONS, over the years. This present films belongs with the best film version of those Dickens classics, in my opinion, however imperfect this or those other films might be, when compared to the original novels in all of their monumental detail and length.This particular Dickens classic deals fundamentally with issues of the rich vs. the poor, and the injustice and oppression too often involved with the former against the latter, and also it\\\\\\'s about \"the wisdom of the head\", associated here with wealth and conservatism, and \"the wisdom of the heart\", associated with the poor and not-so-conservative. (I don\\\\\\'t say \"liberal\", because this isn\\\\\\'t propaganda for liberalism--in fact it has quite a unsympathetic view of Unions, in one key scene--although it does provide some sound criticism of certain Conservative tendencies. In fact, though apolitical, I myself lean towards conservative principles, economically and most especially morally, and yet I find this work presents many compelling criticisms against conservative and even capitalist dogmas.)The actors all did well, and the production was good, too, although I found the intro and outro music a bit unsuitable somehow... But that\\\\\\'s such a small detail, and one doesn\\\\\\'t have to bear it long at all.\\', \\'This is a 1994 BBC adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel “Hard Times.” While the film’s story (which I will not summarize here because I think you already know it) is faithful to that of the original book, the entire film has only about 100 minutes. This means that everything goes on too quickly, to the point of being incoherent. Old Stephen/Rachel story arc suffers most terribly, being badly truncated.Set in a fictitious city called “Coketown,” the story of “Hard Times” follows the life of the Gradgrinds and other characters living in this drab industrial town. Unfortunately, being a low-budget made-for-TV mini-series, “Hard Times” does not show us this dreary and monotonous Coketown very much, which is one of the original novel’s important features.So this adaptation of “Hard Times” goes a little bit like a stage production, with characters talking to each other in a dimly lit, confined space. With stars like Alan Bates (as Bounderby), Bob Peck (as Gradgrind) and Richard E. Grant (as Harthouse), acting is perfect. Unfortunately, writing leaves much to be desired. Where was Andrew Davies when we needed him?“Hard Times” is not exactly the most popular one among the Dickens works. This adaptation is not likely to change that.\\', \\'This is a very overwrought  1977 tv version of HARD TIMES, leaving a great deal out.Bill Paterson is fine as Stephen Blackpool, but Alan Bates nearly consumes the fine Victorian furniture as Josiah Bounderby.The story deserves better treatment.I recommend reading the wonderful book before watching.\\']\\nOur Mutual FriendKindle$0.004.0 out of 5 stars[\"This review is for the MP3 Audio version. I had been looking forward to listening to this after enjoying the MP3 of Little Dorrit, performed superbly by Anton Lesser. Unfortunately, this disc is a disgrace. Apart from the questionable decision of not choosing an English voice to read Dickens, the performance is so lazy and wooden that it sucks all the interest out of the novel. The reader has not even bothered to learn how common London place names are pronounced (\\'Southwark\\' in the first paragraph is not \\'south-wark\\') and has countless weird pronunciations of common English words (\\'ruin\\' is rendered throughout as \\'roon\\'). Given that Dickens is the most dramatic of novelists, including virtual stage directions in the text (\\'he sneered,\\' \\'she sobbed,\\' \\'he roared\\'), there is no excuse for delivering every line using a flat monotone in which even such distinctions as male, female, educated, working class, all sound the same. This recording does Dickens an unforgivable disservice and everyone connected with its production should be ashamed.\", \"The content of this novel has been reviewed by many others, so I will confine my remarks to the MacMillan Collector\\'s Library edition.MCL is a collection of well made pocket sized classics. Pocket sized doesn\\'t quite describe this particular book as it is two inches thick! That\\'s not a complaint. The fat volumes are especially charming. They\\'re still portable. I have a same sized Collectors Library copy of Bleak House that has been carried around for two read throughs.I am at times puzzled by the people MacMillan chooses to write their introductions or afterwords. I\\'ve read ones from people who don\\'t like the work, don\\'t get the point, or can\\'t see past their own worldview enough to write a decent introduction. I am very pleased they had Lucinda Dickens Hawksley do the afterword for this one. She is Charles Dickens great-great-great-grandaughter. She talks about the events in the later part of Dickens\\' life and how they are thematic elements in the novel. She does this without giving away the plot which I appreciate because I am one who reads introductions or afterwords before I read the book.This is a beautiful edition of Dickens\\' last completed novel.\", \\'The first half of this book was a bit of a tough slog, and were it not for the fact that I had it on excellent authority that I was in for a treat, I would have been tempted to give up.  The pace picked up considerably at the start of section 3, though.  This book has a little bit of everything to please an array of tastes.  There are unsavory, disreputable characters (which Dickens did so well), the ridiculous and self-important who are worthy of nothing but contempt, and kind and honorable characters.  There is mystery, murder, greed, romance, jealousy, betrayal, and it is all topped off with a thoroughly satisfying ending.I chose this particular edition over the myriad of others that are available because it included an introduction by Nick Hornby, whose books I love.  Sadly, I could have done without Mr. Hornby\\\\\\'s introduction.  After disparaging many contemporary writers (and there are many out there who may feel rightly so, but I don\\\\\\'t feel the was the appropriate forum to voice this opinion), he then went on to state \". . . it is only fair to warn you that Our Mutual Friend - his last completed novel - is in the opinion of many, including this writer, far from his best.\"  Perhaps the publishers should have looked a little harder to find someone who actually likes and respects the novel to write an introduction, rather than go with a popular writer who clearly does not.Also included in this edition was a list of characters and some charming illustrations.  I don\\\\\\'t know if the list of characters is standard in all editions, but I found it invaluable as I read the first half of the book.  Trying to keep track of something like two dozen principal characters while trying to follow the story would have been near impossible for me without this tool.So let me sum up my rating:  5 stars for the work by Dickens, and 1 star for the introduction by Nick Hornby.\\']\\nA Tale of Two CitiesAudible Audiobook$0.004.3 out of 5 stars[\\'Bought this on my kindle and came to me not as a kindle file but as a photocopy of text. Ridiculous font size and no way to adjust. I wish amazon would not allow products like this. Unreadable.\\', \"I love the story and Dickens is my favorite author so I\\'m not giving him or the story 1 star, but this paperback \\'book\\' format was horrible. The print is tiny with maybe a size 6 font (?) on a horrendously big 8x13 page (bigger than the size of printer paper) so you constantly lose your place when trying to move to the next line/row. Also, because this \\'book\\' is soooo big and awkward in size (but again, with teeny tiny fonts!), you can\\'t fit it into your purse -- you\\'d need a big tote or backpack to carry this around and it takes up too much space on any table/night stand to lay around. The seller did note dimensions in description  so it was my fault for buying but who prints on 8x13 pages with 6 size fonts?! You could at least make the font super BIG for people with vision issues.\", \"A Tale of Two Cities is a definite favorite of mine. Despite being published in 1859, it still has the ability to draw the readier into the story and engage the mind. There are certainly elements of the book that we cannot relate to, living in this day and age. On the whole however, each person can find parallels and lessons applicable to their own life. Like many Dickens novels, there will be what seems like pages of useless details. It can be slow reading at times. Yet by the end of the book, everything comes together in a fantastic story and an ending that will leave you blown away. I can\\'t recommend this book enough.\"]\\nBleak HousePrime Videounknown-price3.6 out of 5 stars[\"The acting is wonderful, in particular, of course, Diana Rigg and her absolute star quality as well as the always terrific Denholm Elliot, but it\\'s a looooooooooong haul and sometimes a truly tedious version of this.  Some of the actors are --  though all are absolutely convincing -- simply not compelling, and they are not helped a bit by one of the darkest, yes, bleakest productions - at times, it\\'s strain to see them.  It\\'s very true to the book, very well adapted, just not very well directed or lit or paced.\", \"First off let me say I have not read the book so I cannot comment on how accurate the show is to the book.  I love BBC adaptations of Charles Dickens\\' works, however, I must agree with another reviewer that this nearly 8 hour adaptation can be tediously slow and drawn out.  You may say anything 8 hours long is drawn out but the 2005 version of Bleak House is also 8 hours and I never felt impatient watching it.  This version seems to have a lot of shots of London streets covered in fog for no other reason than to fill time.  Still, if you are like me and enjoy seeing every version of a beloved story come to life it is worth a go.\", \"This version of Bleak House is well acted and reasonably faithful to the book.  Years back I would have recommended. But it has since been surpassed by the version with Gillian Anderson.  If you\\'re a Dickens fanatic ( like I am ), you\\'ll probably want to watch both film adaptations and read the book again.  There\\'s nothing wrong with that.\"]\\nCharles Dickens: The Man That Asked for MorePrime Videounknown-price3.4 out of 5 stars[\\'If you don\\\\\\'t know anything about the life of the man who wrote \"A Christmas Carol,\" this MIGHT be a good start.

It is up to you.David Copperfield is such an empty vessel, such s pliable lump of clay. How could anyone take interest in him?He does not mark the world but seems to take on the shape impressed on him by those around him. He does not affect the world but is affected by it. If you stop there,, he is the most boring character in the world.But if you watch closely, you will see that he gathers shape from the honest and good hearted around him and seems unaffected by the cruel and heartless people around him. As he grows, he becomes more worthy and more a magnet to the honest and. good hearted. As he becomes more worthy, his story becomes more profound and insightful, if you can see it.  Is Dickens a moldy 18th century relic or a mirror to wholeness and richness in your life? It is more up to you than to Dickens.\", \\'One of the best books ever written. You will never forget David C! I don\\\\\\'t know how I missed it growing up but a book reviewer in the WSJ  alluded to it and said that the main character in his book was much like David: you are sad at the end that you will never get more of him. I broke with my \"best seller\" policy, and love of spy novels and action books, and ordered it. I can\\\\\\'t wait for bedtime to get another hour of reading in of this 1000 page paperback I got fro m Amazon. yes, the start is a little slow until one becomes accustomed to the language and phrasing of the time, but by page 50 the book owns you. Dickens really rocks~!\\', \\'Dickens is the consummate author, whose skills are exceeded by no other. In this, his favorite novel, he takes us on a journey through the life of David Copperfield—his painful childhood, his love for his wonderful Aunt Betsy, who raised her orphaned nephew & always stood by his side, through his lean years and through his successful latter years. Dickens develops the friends & loves of this gentile character (AKA Trotman) in a delicious, spellbinding portraiture. It’s a tale of the best & worst of human character & conditions—some will rise above & some will fall. It’s a tale of abuse, scheming, hatred, and arrogance (the ugliest ice traits of mankind) set apart from humility, kindness & generosity. It is a story of loss & redemption. This wonderful classic kept me enraptured by its ever-changing script. I am truly inspired by this great literary work.\\']\\n'"
