# WebScrapping
simple web scrapping exercise 

# Question 1. 
Amazon Web Scrapping. Write a program that asks the user for the name of an author, and then it returns a .txt file that contains:
•	Titles of the first 20 results for that author in Amazon. 
•	Price for those 20 results (any version available Kindle, hardcover, and paperback). 
•	Ratings for those 20 results. 
•	The first three reviews for each of those 20 results.  
Only include the first 20 results that have all of the above (titles, price, rating, and reviews). There should be an empty line between the results in the text file. Include a try/except block to handle errors (such as misspelling).  Test your code for Charles Dickens.

# Question 2. 
Option 2. Develop a code to interact with API of Facebook or Instagram or Google map. You need to include (in your Jupyter Notebook) a description of what each service is doing, and explain what problem are you solving (basically, describe what you are doing). Include some results.
